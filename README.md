# Redux Versions 2 Demo

This project demonstrates a simple text input with a visibility toggle using Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Project Explanation

The main objective of this project is to showcase how Redux can be used to manage state in a React application. In this demo, we have an input field whose text is revealed only when a checkbox is checked. Redux helps us manage the state of the checkbox and the visibility of the text in the input field.
